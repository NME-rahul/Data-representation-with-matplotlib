#we can change the color of curve by color argument.
#label is use for labeling the curve line. like in this example we create a sin(x) curve.
plt.plot(x, np.sin(x), color='g' , label='sin(x)')

#without legend() it will not show label of graph
plt.legend()

#title() is use for giving title to the graph. don't confuse between curve line labeling and graph title. here the titile of graph is 'Graph of sin(x)'.
