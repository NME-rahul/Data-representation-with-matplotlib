MATplotlib.image as img
Loading image data is supported by the Pillow library. Natively, matplotlib only supports PNG images. The commands shown below fall back on Pillow if the native read fails.

a = img.imread('path') //will give a 3d numpy array(matrix) for coloured images and 2d for black & white.
plt.imshow(a)
plt.show()

#a 24-bit RGB PNG image (8 bits for each of R, G, B)

#RRGGBB format (hexadecimal colour coding 0-F) first two for red, second two for green and third for blue
#000000 means 00 - RR, 00-GG, 00-BB (the value of colour is the colour can be vary from 0 to F)
#FF0000 this gives the red colour with highest luminosity
#00FF00 this gives the green colour with highest luminosity
#0000FF this gives the blue colour with highest luminosity 

#0FCC11 this the mix colour of red(value R=0,R=F), green(value G=C,G=C) and blue(value B=1,B=1)

=> you cant make change in plot that are already rendered
